       <h1>
        1. DIALUCI or LUCIVOLO
         </h1>
       <p>
         This is the most rare and funny ship made in all of history because of how childish it is like you guys only ship them because of how loyal Lucifer is to Diavolo whilst me saying doesn't state the face I don't ship them togethe. Diavolo is a Scorpio that has really good humor and is childish but even with this behaviour doesn't mean that Lord Diavolo is a leninet ruler but quite the opposite of that , stated in Lesson 15 that before all demons were alowed to telaport to the human world but of the issues it cause with indangering humans , Lord Diavolo made the law that only himself,Barbatos and Lucifer can telaport anywhere whilst makeing other demons asked permission to telaport. Lucifer is a Gemmini whom is Lord Diavolos Right Hand Man Personal, he also is the oldest of all the Seven Brothers , Lucifer is bold and is a sadist. So these resson make it even more confuseing that two oposited are togeter which make the a cute ship. <br> <br>                              
       </p>
      <h1>
        2.Solomodeus or SolomonxAsmodeus
      </h1>     
      <p>
        This ship is not ok with me but for veiwers I have to hide it. Solomon is a Sagiterius and is a terrible cook like eating posion is equal to eating a cake made by him , he has made a pacted with lots of deomon and has has some issues with Barbatos which makes it highly unresnable to even be his firend even more than dating him. Well to most shipers they ship Asmodeus and Solomon together is because of Asmo haveing a pact with him. Asmodeus is a Tarus (like me) so he is the avatar of luswt and has a pact with MC and Solomon but in my sence making a pact with MC and Solomon put him a complicated situation like his is double pacted now other tghat that Asmo has a flirty nature to everyone inculeding Solomon and MC which is common thing well he is the avtar of lust for a reson.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Diavmon or DiavoloxMammon
      </h1>
      <p>
        This ship is adorable because of how the fact  that he's also shiped with some of the brothers and he is shipped with alot  of characters but is actually adorable couple because as we know Lord Diavolo is a Scorpio here but Mammon is a Virgo so making it a cute relationship and their is the senario that Mammon likes money and Lord Diavolo is the Crowning Prince make him the richest person in devildom which helps Mammon a spolit brat if he is bottom. But like in genreal it is cuite ship! (p≧w≦q)
      </p>
      <h6>
        Satan x Asmo or Satdeus
      </h6>
      <p>
        This ship is a brotherxbrother ship so it's kind of weird but it's OK because it makes sense on how they act in the game , they like to gossip and they talk about eveything plus sometimes Asmo can <b>Control Satan Mood Swings</b>. Plus Satan also gives Asmodeus alot of stuff related to the dailly gossip like a sip of tea, well this ship might be messy because of Asmo being a Tarus while Satan is a Libra which also a really sweet and cozy relation ship.
